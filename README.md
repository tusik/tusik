ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I am a backend software engineer.

Given that most of my work projects are written in C++ and are highly tailored to specific scenarios, there is a limited amount of open-source content. 

Currently, I am exploring the involvement in open-source projects during my leisure time, and I have a particular fondness for developing with Python and Rust.

## Technology Stack

![Rust Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Rust-CE422B?style=flat-square&logo=rust)

I am learning Rust to replace some work components due to its superior memory safety over C++.

![Cpp Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%2B%2B-aa11cc?style=flat-square&logo=c%2B%2B)

C++ is my primary language for developing desktop applications and creating foundational libraries for interfacing with other systems.

![Python Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-ffde57?style=flat-square&logo=Python)

Python is my go-to language for efficient data manipulation, machine learning tasks, and developing large language models (LLMs).
